transition table representation?

feature to perform functions on arbitrary instances?
what would it return?
or is it returning an abstract type with hidden implementation?
(referencing the email)

node elimination
best way 2 do? (completely new data type? (transitions become strings and all))

quickcheck
plan on using fixed dfa/nfa but testing on arbitrary strings (confined to alphabet)
ok?

equality of languages in different representations?
